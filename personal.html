        <p class="subject-content">Let's start with the fact that I was born on September 2, 1995, and I have the name of a bird of prey in my name -
        something I am proud of and even like. I come from the Subcarpathian region, from the village of Wierzawice ([beginning
        of trivia] Wierzawice is a village located in the Subcarpathian province in the municipality of Lezajsk. One of the
        legends states "(...) that the original name of the village was Wierzeice, meaning gates. It was a village open to the
        world, because in the times of Casimir the Great, grain was sent from here along the San River, through the Vistula
        River all the way to Gdansk, and from there to the world" [end of curiosity]). I have a red car and a bicycle and I like
        to drive them (XD). End of introduction, below is a list of my interests.

                                When I have time I watch a lot of movies, 
                                I generally like cinema (as long as not 
                                romances and dramas, why watch dramas
                                of other people's lives when I have my own XD)

                                Very rarely, but when I am inspired I take my guitar 
                                and record (I have basic equipment, even cool) - 
                                so far I have recorded once, maybe I will upload here, 
                                maybe not.

                                When I want to feel the smell of Polish gymnasium again
                                and return to memoriesI grab my skateboard and hurt my 
                                poor tibias or even my butt, it depends on how I land. 
                                Max what I can or better said, I could 
                                do is kickpflip and bigspin.

                                The last thing I can think of is the gym, I started working
                                out this year and even liked it.
